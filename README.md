**‚ÑπÔ∏è Info**


Service for matching electronics products from ebay. 

It takes a CSV file with products and prices and collects statistics for every item (mean price on eBay, max price, min price, etc.)

At first glance, it seems that eBay's search engine should compare products well on its own, but here's an example for the popular query - iPhone 16 256 GB.

As you can see, only one item satisfies our requirements.

I used the eBay Developer API for finding items and then compared every product with my query using BERT. The model has been trained on my own CSV dataset containing 10,000 rows.
